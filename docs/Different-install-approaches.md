# Ways of installing dhis2
## boombox
In this setup, the DHIS2 stack is installed on an Ubuntu/Windows server direct, without utilizing containers. The installation involves manual execution of commands to set up the PostgreSQL database, Tomcat9, proxy (nginx/apache2), and ultimately deploying the dhis2.war file on the same host. While this approach is straightforward to establish, it may not be suitable for efficient scalability.

## install with the tools (linux)
The tools, i.e dhis2-server-tools and dhis2-tools-ng  installs dhis2 stack adopting lxd containers. dhis2-server-tool uses ansible while  dhis2-tools-ng tools are based on bash cripts. LXD containers gives us more security and modularity, -- it also offer better approach when deploying multiple dhis2 instances.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;"> Consistency and Reproducibility: Automated installers ensure that the deployment process is consistent across different environments, eliminating variations that might occur in manual installations. This consistency makes it easier to reproduce the same setup in various scenarios.</td>
    <td>Debugging and Troubleshooting: When something goes wrong during an automated installation, diagnosing the issue can be more challenging. Manual installation allows you to see each step and pinpoint any errors more easily. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;"> Standardization: Automated installers enforce standardized configurations and best practices. This ensures that all deployments adhere to the same set of guidelines, leading to better security, performance, and maintainability. </td> <td> Learning and Understanding: Manually installing software helps you understand the underlying components and dependencies of the system, which can be valuable for troubleshooting and future maintenance. </td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;">Reduced Human Errors: Manual installations are prone to human errors, such as typos, misconfigurations, and overlooked steps. Automated installers follow predefined scripts or configurations, minimizing the risk of errors. </td>
    <td>Customization: Automated installation scripts or tools usually provide a standardized setup. If your requirements are unique or your application needs specific configurations, automated installations might not cover these needs adequately.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;"> Reusability: Once an automated installer is developed, it can be reused for future deployments, saving time and effort. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where multiple deployments are needed.. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;">Consolidation of Knowledge: Complex deployment procedures often require specialized knowledge. Automated installers encapsulate this knowledge, reducing the reliance on specific individuals and promoting knowledge sharing

    <td>Changing Requirements: If your needs change over time, automated installations might not be flexible enough to adapt. Manual installations give you more control over changes. <br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: left;"> Less Skill-Dependent: Automated installations can be executed by individuals with varying levels of expertise. This reduces the dependency on highly skilled personnel for deployment tasks. </td>
    <td> Complex Configurations: Some applications have complex configurations that cannot be fully captured by automated scripts. Manually configuring such applications might ensure that all the necessary settings are in place </td>

## install with docker
You can also get dhis2 up and running with docker containers. There is a docker compose file which has all the containers ordered according to how they are dependent to one another and it automates bringing up bringing up the stack at once.
